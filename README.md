## My CLI Calculator App
Hey there!
This is a simple command-line calculator I built using Python. It lets you do basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I made it using loops, conditionals, classes, and exception handling to make sure it doesn’t crash when you enter something weird.

## What It Can Do
-  Add, subtract, multiply, divide two numbers
-  Ask if you want to reuse the same numbers or enter new ones
-  Handles errors like dividing by zero or typing letters instead of numbers
-  Uses a class to keep the code clean and organized

## How to Run It
- Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x)
- Clone this repo or download the .py file
- Open your terminal and run:
Command to Execute- python calculator.py



## Example Output
Welcome to My Calculator CLI App....
Enter First Number:> 10
Enter Second Number:> 5

Choose Operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter Your Choice(1/2/3/4/5):> 4
Result:> 2.0

Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no):> yes
Do you want to use the same numbers? (yes/no):> no

## Why I Made This
I’m learning Python and wanted to try building something useful with the basics I’ve learned so far. This project helped me understand how to use classes, loops, and error handling in real scenarios. Plus, it was fun to make!

## Future Ideas
- Add more operations like power, modulus, etc.
- Save calculation history
- Maybe turn it into a GUI app later with Tkinter or Streamlit
